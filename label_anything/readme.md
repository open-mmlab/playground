# OpenMMLab PlayGround: Semi-Automated Annotation with Label-Studio and SAM

This article introduces a semi-automatic annotation solution combining Label-Studio and SAM (Segment Anything) with two methods: Point2Label and Bbox2Label. With Point2Label, users only need to click a point within the object's area to obtain the object's mask and bounding box annotations. With Bbox2Label, users simply annotate the object's bounding box to generate the object's mask. Community users can learn from these methods to improve the efficiency of data annotation.

- SAM (Segment Anything) is a segmentation model launched by Meta AI, designed to segment everything.
- [Label Studio](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio) is an excellent annotation software, covering dataset annotation functions in areas such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

This article will use images from the [Cat Dataset](https://download.openmmlab.com/mmyolo/data/cat_dataset.zip) for semi-automated annotation.

## Environment Setup

Create a virtual environment:

```shell
conda create -n rtmdet-sam python=3.9 -y
conda activate rtmdet-sam
```

Clone OpenMMLab PlayGround

```shell
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/playground
```

Install PyTorch

```shell
# Linux and Windows CUDA 11.3
pip install torch==1.10.1+cu113 torchvision==0.11.2+cu113 torchaudio==0.10.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html


# Linux and Windows CPU only
pip install torch==1.10.1+cpu torchvision==0.11.2+cpu torchaudio==0.10.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html

# OSX
pip install torch==1.10.1 torchvision==0.11.2 torchaudio==0.10.1

```

Install SAM and download the pre-trained model:

```shell
cd path/to/playground/label_anything
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth

# For better segmentation results, use the sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth weights
# wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_l_0b3195.pth
# wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
```


Install Label-Studio 和 label-studio-ml-backend

```shell
# sudo apt install libpq-dev python3-dev # Note: If using Label Studio 1.7.2 version, you need to install libpq-dev and python3-dev dependencies.

# Installing label-studio may take some time. If you cannot find the version, please use the official source.
pip install label-studio==1.7.3
pip install label-studio-ml==1.0.9
```

## Start the service:
⚠label_anything requires the SAM backend to be enabled and then the web service to be started before the model can be loaded. (a total of two steps are required to start)

1.Start the SAM backend inference service:

```shell
cd path/to/playground/label_anything

label-studio-ml start sam --port 8003 --with \
  sam_config=vit_b \
  out_mask=True \
  out_bbox=True \
  device=cuda:0
# device=cuda:0 is for using GPU inference. If you want to use CPU inference, replace cuda:0 with cpu.
# out_poly=True returns the annotation of the bounding polygon.
```

At this point, the SAM backend inference service has started. 

⚠The above terminal window needs to be kept open.

Next, please follow the steps below to configure the use of the back-end reasoning service in the Label-Studio Web system.

2.Now start the Label-Studio web service:

Please create a new terminal window to access the label_anything project path.

```shell
cd path/to/playground/label_anything
```

⚠(Please skip this step if you do not use SAM with vit-h) The inference backend used is SAM's **vit-h**, which requires the following environment variables to be set due to the long loading time of the model, which causes the connection to the backend to time out.

The specific can be set according to the name of the downloaded SAM's weights, such as sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth for vit-h and sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth for vit-b.

```shell
# Linux requires the following commands
export ML_TIMEOUT_SETUP=40
# Windows requires the following commands
set ML_TIMEOUT_SETUP=40
```

Start Label-Studio web service:
```shell
label-studio start
```

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the Label-Studio interface.

![](https://cdn.vansin.top/picgo20230330133118.png)

We will register a user and then create an OpenMMLabPlayGround project.

![](https://cdn.vansin.top/picgo20230330133333.png)

We will download the example Meow Meow images using the method below, click on Data Import to import the cat images that need to be annotated, and then click Save to create the project.

```shell
cd path/to/playground/label_anything
mkdir data && cd data

wget https://download.openmmlab.com/mmyolo/data/cat_dataset.zip && unzip cat_dataset.zip
```

![](https://cdn.vansin.top/picgo20230330133715.png)


Configure Label-Studio keypoint, Mask, and other annotations in Settings/Labeling Interface.

```xml
<View>
  <Image name="image" value="$image" zoom="true"/>
  <KeyPointLabels name="KeyPointLabels" toName="image">
    <Label value="cat" smart="true" background="#e51515" showInline="true"/>
    <Label value="person" smart="true" background="#412cdd" showInline="true"/>
  </KeyPointLabels>
  <RectangleLabels name="RectangleLabels" toName="image">
  	<Label value="cat" background="#FF0000"/>
  	<Label value="person" background="#0d14d3"/>
  </RectangleLabels>
  <PolygonLabels name="PolygonLabels" toName="image">
  	<Label value="cat" background="#FF0000"/>
  	<Label value="person" background="#0d14d3"/>
  </PolygonLabels>
  <BrushLabels name="BrushLabels" toName="image">
  	<Label value="cat" background="#FF0000"/>
  	<Label value="person" background="#0d14d3"/>
  </BrushLabels>
</View>
```
In the above XML, we have configured the annotations, where KeyPointLabels are for keypoint annotations, BrushLabels are for Mask annotations, PolygonLabels are for bounding polygon annotations, and RectangleLabels are for rectangle annotations. 

This example uses two categories, cat and person. If community users want to add more categories, they need to add the corresponding categories in KeyPointLabels, BrushLabels, PolygonLabels, and RectangleLabels respectively.

Next, copy and add the above XML to Label-Studio, and then click Save.

After that, go to Settings and click Add Model to add the OpenMMLabPlayGround backend inference service. Set the URL http://localhost:8003 for the SAM backend inference service, enable Use for interactive preannotations, and click Validate and Save.

⚠If you are unable to execute successfully at this step, probably due to the long model loading time, which causes the connection to the backend to time out, please re-execute `export ML_TIMEOUT_SETUP=40` (linux) or `set ML_TIMEOUT_SETUP=40` (windows) and restart the `label-studio start` SAM backend reasoning service.

If you see "Connected" as shown below, it means that the backend inference service has been successfully added.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25839884/233832884-1b282d1f-1f43-474b-b41d-de41ad248476.png)

## Start semi-automated annotation.

Click on Label to start annotating.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25839884/233833125-fd372b0d-5f3b-49f4-bcf9-e89971639fd5.png)

To use this feature, enable the Auto-Annotation toggle and it is recommended to check the Auto accept annotation suggestions option. Then click the Smart tool on the right side, switch to Point mode, and select the object label you want to annotate from the options below, in this case, choose "cat." If using Bbox2Label, please switch the Smart tool to Rectangle mode instead.

Point2Label: As can be seen from the following gif animation, by simply clicking a point on the object, the SAM algorithm is able to segment and detect the entire object.

![SAM8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25839884/233835410-29896554-963a-42c3-a523-3b1226de59b6.gif)


Bbox2Label: As can be seen from the following gif animation, by simply annotating a bounding box, the SAM algorithm is able to segment and detect the entire object.

![SAM10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25839884/233969712-0d9d6f0a-70b0-4b3e-b054-13eda037fb20.gif)

## COCO format dataset export

### Label Studio web export

After submitting all the images, click on export to export the annotated dataset in COCO format, which will generate a compressed file of the annotated dataset. Note: only the bounding box annotations are exported here. If you want to export the instance segmentation annotations, you need to set out_poly=True when starting the SAM backend service.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25839884/233835852-b2f56cf1-1608-44c8-aa2d-d876f58e61f3.png)

You can use VS Code to open the extracted folder and see the annotated dataset, which includes the images and the annotated JSON files.

### Label Studio Output Conversion to RLE Format Masks

Since the coco exported by label studio does not support rle instance labeling, it only supports polygon instances.

The polygon instance format is not easy to control the number of points, too much is not easy to fine tune (unlike mask which can be fine tuned with an eraser) and too little area is not accurate.

Here we provide a conversion script to convert the json format of label-studio output to COCO format.

⚠ Currently this script only supports label-studio projects with completed annotations.

```shell
cd path/to/playground/label_anything
python tools/convert_to_rle_mask_coco.py --json_file_path path/to/LS_json --out_dir path/to/output/file
```

--json_file_path Enter the output json from Label studio

--out_dir Output path


After generation the script outputs a list in the terminal that corresponds to the category ids and can be used to copy and fill the config for training.

Under the output path, there are two folders: annotations and images, annotations is the coco format json, and images is the sorted dataset.
```
Your dataset
├── annotations
│   ├── ann.json
├── images
```

## Making a config and visualizing the generated dataset (optional)

This section describes how to visualize the generated dataset using `browse_dataset.py` in mmdetection.

First get mmdetection in the playground directory.

```shell
cd path/to/playground/
# build from source
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.git
cd mmdetection; pip install -e . ; cd .
```

Then use this script to output the config for training on demand, where the template `mask-rcnn_r50_fpn` is provided in `label_anything/config_template`.


```shell
#Install Jinja2
pip install Jinja2
cd path/to/playground/label_anything
python tools/convert_to_rle_mask_coco.py --json_file_path path/to/LS_json --out_dir path/to/output/file --out_config config_mode
```

--out_config Select your template ``mask-rcnn_r50_fpn``.

Here it is recommended that `--out_dir` be `. /mmdetection/data/my_set` to facilitate training with mmdetection.

After the conversion, you can find the converted dataset and the generated config under `mmdetection/data/my_set`.

```
playground
├── mmdetection
│   ├── data
│   │   ├── my_set
│   │   │   ├── annotations
│   │   │   │   ├── ann.json
│   │   │   ├── images
│   │   │   ├── mask-rcnn_r50_fpn.py
├── ...
```

Then we visualize the dataset using ``tools/analysis_tools/browse_dataset.py``.

```shell
cd path/to/playground/mmdetection

python tools/analysis_tools/browse_dataset.py data/my_set/mask-rcnn_r50_fpn.py --output-dir output_dir
```

The visualization results will be saved in `output_dir` under the mmdetection project path.

The following is the result of the transformation using the transformed dataset via `tools/analysis_tools/browse_dataset.py`.

## Training with mmdetection on the generated dataset (optional)

After the previous step a config is generated that can be used for mmdetection training, the path is ``data/my_set/config_name.py`` which we can use for training.


```shell
python tools/train.py data/my_set/mask-rcnn_r50_fpn.py
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101508488/236632841-4008225c-a3cd-4f2f-a034-08ded4127029.png)

After training, you can use ``tools/test.py`` for testing.

```shell
python tools/test.py data/my_set/mask-rcnn_r50_fpn.py path/of/your/checkpoint --show --show-dir my_show
```
The visualization image will be saved in `work_dir/{timestamp}/my_show`

When finished, we can get the model test visualization. On the left is the annotation image, and on the right is the model output.
