        Instantiate a pretrained flax model from a pre-trained model configuration.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not initialized from pretrained model* means that the weights of XXX do not come
        pretrained with the rest of the model. It is up to you to train those weights with a downstream fine-tuning
        task.

        The warning *Weights from XXX not used in YYY* means that the layer XXX is not used by YYY, therefore those
        weights are discarded.

        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`):
                Can be either:

                    - A string, the *model id* of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co.
                      Valid model ids are namespaced under a user or organization name, like
                      `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`.
                    - A path to a *directory* containing model weights saved using [`~ModelMixin.save_pretrained`],
                      e.g., `./my_model_directory/`.
            dtype (`jax.numpy.dtype`, *optional*, defaults to `jax.numpy.float32`):
                The data type of the computation. Can be one of `jax.numpy.float32`, `jax.numpy.float16` (on GPUs) and
                `jax.numpy.bfloat16` (on TPUs).

                This can be used to enable mixed-precision training or half-precision inference on GPUs or TPUs. If
                specified all the computation will be performed with the given `dtype`.

                **Note that this only specifies the dtype of the computation and does not influence the dtype of model
                parameters.**

                If you wish to change the dtype of the model parameters, see [`~ModelMixin.to_fp16`] and
                [`~ModelMixin.to_bf16`].
            model_args (sequence of positional arguments, *optional*):
                All remaining positional arguments will be passed to the underlying model's `__init__` method.
            cache_dir (`Union[str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the
                standard cache should not be used.
            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force the (re-)download of the model weights and configuration files, overriding the
                cached versions if they exist.
            resume_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to delete incompletely received files. Will attempt to resume the download if such a
                file exists.
            proxies (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            local_files_only(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to only look at local files (i.e., do not try to download the model).
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.
            from_pt (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a PyTorch checkpoint save file.
            kwargs (remaining dictionary of keyword arguments, *optional*):
                Can be used to update the configuration object (after it being loaded) and initiate the model (e.g.,
                `output_attentions=True`). Behaves differently depending on whether a `config` is provided or
                automatically loaded:

                    - If a configuration is provided with `config`, `**kwargs` will be directly passed to the
                      underlying model's `__init__` method (we assume all relevant updates to the configuration have
                      already been done)
                    - If a configuration is not provided, `kwargs` will be first passed to the configuration class
                      initialization function ([`~ConfigMixin.from_config`]). Each key of `kwargs` that corresponds to
                      a configuration attribute will be used to override said attribute with the supplied `kwargs`
                      value. Remaining keys that do not correspond to any configuration attribute will be passed to the
                      underlying model's `__init__` function.

        Examples:

        ```python
        >>> from diffusers import FlaxUNet2DConditionModel

        >>> # Download model and configuration from huggingface.co and cache.
        >>> model, params = FlaxUNet2DConditionModel.from_pretrained("runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5")
