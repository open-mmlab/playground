# Research projects

This folder contains various research projects using ðŸ§¨ Diffusers. 
They are not really maintained by the core maintainers of this library and often require a specific version of Diffusers that is indicated in the requirements file of each folder. 
Updating them to the most recent version of the library will require some work.

To use any of them, just run the command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
inside the folder of your choice.

If you need help with any of those, please open an issue where you directly ping the author(s), as indicated at the top of the README of each folder.
