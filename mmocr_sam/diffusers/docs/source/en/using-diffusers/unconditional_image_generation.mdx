# Unconditional image generation

[[open-in-colab]]

Unconditional image generation is a relatively straightforward task. The model only generates images - without any additional context like text or an image - resembling the training data it was trained on.

The [`DiffusionPipeline`] is the easiest way to use a pre-trained diffusion system for inference.

Start by creating an instance of [`DiffusionPipeline`] and specify which pipeline checkpoint you would like to download.
You can use any of the ðŸ§¨ Diffusers [checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?library=diffusers&sort=downloads) from the Hub (the checkpoint you'll use generates images of butterflies).

<Tip>

ðŸ’¡ Want to train your own unconditional image generation model? Take a look at the training [guide](training/unconditional_training) to learn how to generate your own images.

</Tip>

In this guide, you'll use [`DiffusionPipeline`] for unconditional image generation with [DDPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239):

```python
>>> from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

>>> generator = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("anton-l/ddpm-butterflies-128")
```

The [`DiffusionPipeline`] downloads and caches all modeling, tokenization, and scheduling components. 
Because the model consists of roughly 1.4 billion parameters, we strongly recommend running it on a GPU.
You can move the generator object to a GPU, just like you would in PyTorch:

```python
>>> generator.to("cuda")
```

Now you can use the `generator` to generate an image:

```python
>>> image = generator().images[0]
```

The output is by default wrapped into a [`PIL.Image`](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html?highlight=image#the-image-class) object.

You can save the image by calling:

```python
>>> image.save("generated_image.png")
```

Try out the Spaces below, and feel free to play around with the inference steps parameter to see how it affects the image quality!
