# Using Diffusers for reinforcement learning

Support for one RL model and related pipelines is included in the `experimental` source of diffusers.
More models and examples coming soon!

# Diffuser Value-guided Planning

You can run the model from [*Planning with Diffusion for Flexible Behavior Synthesis*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09991) with Diffusers.
The script is located in the [RL Examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/rl) folder.

Or, run this example in Colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/reinforcement_learning_with_diffusers.ipynb)
