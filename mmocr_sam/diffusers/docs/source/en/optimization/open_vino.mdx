# How to use OpenVINO for inference

ðŸ¤— [Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel) provides a Stable Diffusion pipeline compatible with OpenVINO. You can now easily perform inference with OpenVINO Runtime on a variety of Intel processors ([see](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_OV_UG_supported_plugins_Supported_Devices.html) the full list of supported devices).

## Installation

Install ðŸ¤— Optimum Intel with the following command:

```
pip install optimum["openvino"]
```

## Stable Diffusion Inference

To load an OpenVINO model and run inference with OpenVINO Runtime, you need to replace `StableDiffusionPipeline` with `OVStableDiffusionPipeline`. In case you want to load a PyTorch model and convert it to the OpenVINO format on-the-fly, you can set `export=True`.

```python
from optimum.intel.openvino import OVStableDiffusionPipeline

model_id = "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"
pipe = OVStableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, export=True)
prompt = "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
images = pipe(prompt).images[0]
```

You can find more examples (such as static reshaping and model compilation) in [optimum documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference#export-and-inference-of-stable-diffusion-models).
