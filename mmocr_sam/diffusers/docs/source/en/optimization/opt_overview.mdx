# Overview

Generating high-quality outputs is computationally intensive, especially during each iterative step where you go from a noisy output to a less noisy output. One of ðŸ§¨ Diffuser's goal is to make this technology widely accessible to everyone, which includes enabling fast inference on consumer and specialized hardware. 

This section will cover tips and tricks - like half-precision weights and sliced attention - for optimizing inference speed and reducing memory-consumption. You can also learn how to speed up your PyTorch code with [`torch.compile`](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_compile_tutorial.html) or [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/), and enable memory-efficient attention with [xFormers](https://facebookresearch.github.io/xformers/). There are also guides for running inference on specific hardware like Apple Silicon, and Intel or Habana processors.
