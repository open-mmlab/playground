# Logging

ðŸ§¨ Diffusers has a centralized logging system, so that you can setup the verbosity of the library easily.

Currently the default verbosity of the library is `WARNING`.

To change the level of verbosity, just use one of the direct setters. For instance, here is how to change the verbosity
to the INFO level.

```python
import diffusers

diffusers.logging.set_verbosity_info()
```

You can also use the environment variable `DIFFUSERS_VERBOSITY` to override the default verbosity. You can set it
to one of the following: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`. For example:

```bash
DIFFUSERS_VERBOSITY=error ./myprogram.py
```

Additionally, some `warnings` can be disabled by setting the environment variable
`DIFFUSERS_NO_ADVISORY_WARNINGS` to a true value, like *1*. This will disable any warning that is logged using
[`logger.warning_advice`]. For example:

```bash
DIFFUSERS_NO_ADVISORY_WARNINGS=1 ./myprogram.py
```

Here is an example of how to use the same logger as the library in your own module or script:

```python
from diffusers.utils import logging

logging.set_verbosity_info()
logger = logging.get_logger("diffusers")
logger.info("INFO")
logger.warning("WARN")
```


All the methods of this logging module are documented below, the main ones are
[`logging.get_verbosity`] to get the current level of verbosity in the logger and
[`logging.set_verbosity`] to set the verbosity to the level of your choice. In order (from the least
verbose to the most verbose), those levels (with their corresponding int values in parenthesis) are:

- `diffusers.logging.CRITICAL` or `diffusers.logging.FATAL` (int value, 50): only report the most
  critical errors.
- `diffusers.logging.ERROR` (int value, 40): only report errors.
- `diffusers.logging.WARNING` or `diffusers.logging.WARN` (int value, 30): only reports error and
  warnings. This the default level used by the library.
- `diffusers.logging.INFO` (int value, 20): reports error, warnings and basic information.
- `diffusers.logging.DEBUG` (int value, 10): report all information.

By default, `tqdm` progress bars will be displayed during model download. [`logging.disable_progress_bar`] and [`logging.enable_progress_bar`] can be used to suppress or unsuppress this behavior.
