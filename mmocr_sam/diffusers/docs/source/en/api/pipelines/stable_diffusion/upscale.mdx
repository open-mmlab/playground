# Super-Resolution

## StableDiffusionUpscalePipeline

The upscaler diffusion model was created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), and [LAION](https://laion.ai/), as part of Stable Diffusion 2.0. [`StableDiffusionUpscalePipeline`] can be used to enhance the resolution of input images by a factor of 4.

The original codebase can be found here: 
- *Stable Diffusion v2*: [Stability-AI/stablediffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion#image-upscaling-with-stable-diffusion)

Available Checkpoints are:
- *stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler (x4 resolution resolution)*: [stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler)
