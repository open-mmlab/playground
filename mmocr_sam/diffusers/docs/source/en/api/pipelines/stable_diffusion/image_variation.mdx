# Image Variation

## StableDiffusionImageVariationPipeline

[`StableDiffusionImageVariationPipeline`] lets you generate variations from an input image using Stable Diffusion. It uses a fine-tuned version of Stable Diffusion model, trained by  [Justin Pinkney](https://www.justinpinkney.com/) (@Buntworthy) at [Lambda](https://lambdalabs.com/).

The original codebase can be found here:

Available Checkpoints are:
