# Stable Diffusion Latent Upscaler

## StableDiffusionLatentUpscalePipeline

The Stable Diffusion Latent Upscaler model was created by [Katherine Crowson](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion) in collaboration with [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/). It can be used on top of any [`StableDiffusionUpscalePipeline`] checkpoint to enhance its output image resolution by a factor of 2.

A notebook that demonstrates the original implementation can be found here: 
- [Stable Diffusion Upscaler Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o1qYJcFeywzCIdkfKJy7cTpgZTCM2EI4)

Available Checkpoints are:
- *stabilityai/latent-upscaler*: [stabilityai/sd-x2-latent-upscaler](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-x2-latent-upscaler)
