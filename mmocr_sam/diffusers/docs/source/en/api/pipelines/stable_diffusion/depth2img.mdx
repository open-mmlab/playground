# Depth-to-Image Generation

## StableDiffusionDepth2ImgPipeline

The depth-guided stable diffusion model was created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), and [LAION](https://laion.ai/), as part of Stable Diffusion 2.0. It uses [MiDas](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS) to infer depth based on an image.

[`StableDiffusionDepth2ImgPipeline`] lets you pass a text prompt and an initial image to condition the generation of new images as well as a `depth_map` to preserve the imagesâ€™ structure. 

The original codebase can be found here: 
- *Stable Diffusion v2*: [Stability-AI/stablediffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion#depth-conditional-stable-diffusion)

Available Checkpoints are:
