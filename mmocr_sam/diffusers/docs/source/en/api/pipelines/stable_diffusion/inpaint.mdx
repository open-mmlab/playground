# Text-Guided Image Inpainting

## StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline

The Stable Diffusion model was created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), [runway](https://github.com/runwayml), and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). The [`StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline`] lets you edit specific parts of an image by providing a mask and a text prompt using Stable Diffusion.

The original codebase can be found here: 
- *Stable Diffusion V1*: [CampVis/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/runwayml/stable-diffusion#inpainting-with-stable-diffusion)
- *Stable Diffusion V2*: [Stability-AI/stablediffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion#image-inpainting-with-stable-diffusion)

Available checkpoints are:
- *stable-diffusion-inpainting (512x512 resolution)*: [runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting)
- *stable-diffusion-2-inpainting (512x512 resolution)*: [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting)
