# Euler scheduler

## Overview

Euler scheduler (Algorithm 2) from the paper [Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364) by Karras et al. (2022). Based on the original [k-diffusion](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion/blob/481677d114f6ea445aa009cf5bd7a9cdee909e47/k_diffusion/sampling.py#L51) implementation by Katherine Crowson.
Fast scheduler which often times generates good outputs with 20-30 steps.
