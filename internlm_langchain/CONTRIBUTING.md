# 贡献指南

欢迎！我们是一个非常友好的社区，非常高兴您想要帮助我们让这个应用程序变得更好。但是，请您遵循一些通用准则以保持组织有序。

1. 确保为您要修复的错误或要添加的功能创建了一个[问题](https://github.com/imClumsyPanda/langchain-ChatGLM/issues)，尽可能保持它们小。
2. 请使用 `git pull --rebase` 来拉取和衍合上游的更新。
3. 将提交合并为格式良好的提交。在提交说明中单独一行提到要解决的问题，如`Fix #<bug>`（有关更多可以使用的关键字，请参见[将拉取请求链接到问题](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)）。
4. 推送到`dev`。在说明中提到正在解决的问题。

# Contribution Guide

Welcome! We're a pretty friendly community, and we're thrilled that you want to help make this app even better. However, we ask that you follow some general guidelines to keep things organized around here.

1. Make sure an [issue](https://github.com/imClumsyPanda/langchain-ChatGLM/issues) is created for the bug you're about to fix, or feature you're about to add. Keep them as small as possible.

2. Please use `git pull --rebase` to fetch and merge updates from the upstream.

3. Rebase commits into well-formatted commits. Mention the issue being resolved in the commit message on a line all by itself like `Fixes #<bug>` (refer to [Linking a pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) for more keywords you can use).

4. Push into `dev`.  Mention which bug is being resolved in the description.
