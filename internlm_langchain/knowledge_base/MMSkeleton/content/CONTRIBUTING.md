## Code style

### Python
We adopt [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as the preferred code style.
We use [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) as the linter and [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) as the formatter.
Please upgrade to the latest yapf (>=0.27.0) and refer to the [configuration](../.style.yapf).

>Before you create a PR, make sure that your code lints and is formatted by yapf.
